## 🧠 About Me

I’m a Data Analyst with **6+ years of experience** turning messy business data into clear, actionable insights—mostly in **B2B sales and industrial automation**.  
I enjoy building reliable data pipelines, automating boring manual work, and designing dashboards that actually get used.

I believe data should **explain reality, not decorate it**.
